Assignment 1 for COSC 499

## This repository has 3 branches:
- **feature-1:** Containing code for feature-1, which has a method called ```arraySort()``` to sort a given array of integers or characters. It also contains a method called ```testArraySort()``` to test the method with 3 different types of test arrays.
- **feature-2:** Containing code for feature-2, which has a method called ```pi()``` that returns the product of PI and the given argument. The returned result is cast into an integer. It also contains another method called ```testPi()``` to test the aforementioned method with 3 test cases.
- **main:** The main branch consists the code merged from the above 2 branches, and this README file.

*Please check the **EXPLANATION** file for detailed info about ```feature-1``` and ```feature-2```.*

## Instructions:
- All code is written using Java. Therefore, it can be executed as any other Java program. 
- The features are coded in their individual files (**feature1.java** and **feature2.java**) and can be executed from there.
- The files also contain JUnit tests for both the features and can be executed there.

## Note:
The result of the tests ran are not printed on the console. Instead, it is notified on the left side of the screen, as can also be seen in the video. Testing was done with the help of JUnit Java extensions in VSCode.
The ***Coding Pack for Java*** and ***Extension Pack for Java*** plugins were used to enable Java and JUnit in VSCode editor. The instructions for installing the same could be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java).
