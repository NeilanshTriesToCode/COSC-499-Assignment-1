## Feature-1 branch
- Has a method in the **feature1.java** file called ```arraySort()```. It takes an array as input and sorts it in ascending order. 
- The file also contains a JUnit test method called ```testArraySort()``` with 3 test cases:
    - {3, 4, 5, 2, 1}
    - {'x', 'p', 'z', 'a', 'q', 'g', 'm'}
    - {77, 55, 101, 8, 14}
- The test passes for all the three cases. 
- The **feature2.java** in this branch does not have any code. The code for feature-2 can be found in the **feature-2** branch and the **main** branch.
   
 
## Feature-2 branch
- Has a method in the **feature2.java** file called ```pi()```. It takes an integer input and returns the product of the integer and PI. The returned result is cast into an integer. 
- The file also contains a JUnit test method called ```testPi()``` with 3 test cases:
    - 3
    - 4
    - 9
- The test passes for all the three cases. 
- The **feature1.java** in this branch does not have any code. Likewise, the code for feature-1 can be found in the **feature-1** branch and the **main** branch.

## Note:
The result of the tests ran are not printed on the console. Instead, it is notified on the left side of the screen, as can also be seen in the video. Testing was done with the help of JUnit Java extensions in VSCode.
The ***Coding Pack for Java*** and ***Extension Pack for Java*** plugins were used to enable Java and JUnit in VSCode editor. The instructions for installing the same could be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java).
